# ChatControl Free
ChatControl Pro is a legendary chat plugin that took the marketplace by storm in 2013 and has since generated over 500,000 downloads.

**Notice**: ChatControl Free has been replaced by [ChatControl Red](https://mineacademy.org/chatcontrol). We will still update ChatControl Free but for new features such as HEX, Bungee, [item] placeholder etc. upgrade to ChatControl Red.

* Completely eliminate, prevent and punish swears, ads, spam and anything you want by customizable filters
* Anti-spam and chat limits
* Anti-duplication for messages and commands
* Bot prevention
* Support for regular expressions to create custom filters
* Thousands of placeholders

Check out https://mineacademy.org/plugins for more information.

For the time being we do not offer a separate Wikipedia for the free version. Instead, you are welcome to check **[ChatControl's Pro Wikipedia](https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki)** that contains very similar information, except that some features are missing or labeled differently in the free version. Please keep in mind that ChatControl Free is no longer receiving updates except for critical vulnerability patches. To support our development, please consider purchasing the Pro version!

If you have any **questions or bugs to report**, try seeing if [those can be resolved quickly](https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) by yourself. If that does not help, you are welcome to **fill an issue**. Please read the [Getting Help the Best Way](https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Getting-Help-the-Right-Way) to obtain help as quickly as possible.

Dave Thomas, founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy:

<i>Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.</i>
